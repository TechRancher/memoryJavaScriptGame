# memoryJavaScriptGame

Welcome to my JavaScript Memory Game.
I got this idea from Marina Ferreira, Github link [marina-ferreira](https://github.com/marina-ferreira).  Here is a link [Memory Game](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/vanilla-javascript-tutorial-build-a-memory-game-in-30-minutes-e542c4447eae) to were she does a break down how to write the code. I added to the project by added location.reload() to when you win the game. I will be adding more to this project in the next couple of days.
The object of the game is to find two matching cards.
